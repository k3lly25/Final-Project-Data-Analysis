COVID-19 Fake News Detection Based on Natural Language Processing

## Background

​	In recent years, major emergencies have occurred frequently around the world.
​	With the advent of social media, there has been an extremely rapid growth in the content shared online. As a result, the spread of fake news and posts on social media platforms has also increased dramatically.
​	When a global public health emergency like COVID-19 broke out, more and more fake news in social media networks were exposed to the public.

​	First, we implemented a natural language processing based COVID-19 fake news detection method as well as a visualization method, and reproduced the detection as well as visualization process by combining true news datasets and complete code.
​	Secondly, to achieve automatic detection of coronavirus fake news, I defined features that compare them with news headlines and news article content itself.
​	Finally, we used these features to fit an SVM model to describe our fake news detection system that automatically determines the authenticity of news related to COVID-19.
